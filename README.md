# Alt React Demo

This is a build-free alternative to React, written in Vanilla JS. There's no transpiling, no build steps, and no dependencies.

**[Check out the companion blog post for the thinking behind this.](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/09/11/web-dev-nirvana-and-why-I-needed-to-let-go-of-reactjs-to-reach-it/)**

The demo app is [a Password Generator](https://bryanbraun.com/alt-react-demo).

## Setup

None, lol.

Just [run SimpleHTTPServer](https://2ality.com/2014/06/simple-http-server.html) to serve your files:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

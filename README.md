# Alt React Demo

This is a demo app that uses vanilla JavaScript and a react-like architecture to build a client-side app, with no builds or tooling.

The Goal: Get the benefits of a React without any workflow nonsense.

## Setup

None, lol.

Just [run SimpleHTTPServer](https://2ality.com/2014/06/simple-http-server.html) to serve your files:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

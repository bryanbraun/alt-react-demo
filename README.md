# Alt React Demo

This is a build-free alternative to React, written in Vanilla JS. There's no transpiling, no build steps, and no dependencies.

For the thinking behind this, see the companion blog post: [Web-dev nirvana, and why I needed to let go of React to reach it](https://bryanbraun.com/2019/09/02/web-dev-nirvana-and-why-I-needed-to-let-go-of-reactjs-to-reach-it/)

The demo app is a Password Generator. See it here: [https://bryanbraun.com/alt-react-demo](https://www.bryanbraun.com/alt-react-demo/)

## Setup

None, lol.

Just [run SimpleHTTPServer](https://2ality.com/2014/06/simple-http-server.html) to serve your files:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
